OpenDataSection - Declares a data section
	flags (byte)
		mergeable
		structural
		readonly
	structure reference (index) (if structural)

Data section opcodes:
	0-13: Emit LType count x (opcode + 1) (low 4 bits are LType)
		0: S8
		1: S16
		2: S32
		3: S64
		4: U8
		5: U16
		6: U32
		7: U64
		8: F32,
		9: F64,
		10: NULL
		11: DATA
		12: DATAOFFSET
	14: Seek (low 4 bits are signed offset, except 0 means long-seek)
	15: End of section

Data coded LTypes are all coded verbatim
